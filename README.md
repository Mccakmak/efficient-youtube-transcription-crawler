# High Speed YouTube Transcription Collection

This repository provides a robust system for collecting, generating, and translating transcripts from YouTube videos using a combination of parallel processing, Whisper speech-to-text, and multilingual translation models.

The methodology significantly accelerates transcript acquisition from large video datasets, addressing common issues such as unavailable captions, language barriers, and API rate limits. It supports tasks ranging from crawling, transcription, translation, and merging‚Äîall executed efficiently via multiprocessing and GPU acceleration.

## üîç Features

- üì∫ Collects available captions from YouTube using [youtube-transcript-api](https://github.com/jdepoix/youtube-transcript-api)
- üß† Uses OpenAI's Whisper (and `faster-whisper`) to transcribe videos without captions
- üåç Translates non-English transcripts to English via `googletrans` or M2M100
- ‚ö° Fully parallelized using Python's `multiprocessing` and `concurrent.futures` for both I/O and CPU-bound tasks
- üì¶ Modular scripts for collection, transcription, translation, and merging
- üìà Scales with GPUs for Whisper transcription and translation efficiency
